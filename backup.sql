A M E   O V E R V I E W\nIn  Terraforming  Mars,  you  control  a  corporation, \nand  you  buy  and  play  cards  describing  different  projects. \nThe  projects  often  directly  or  indirectly  contribute  to  the \nterraforming  process,  but  can  also  consist  of  business \nenterprises  of  different  kinds.  In  order  to  win,  you  have  to \naccumulate a good terraform rating (TR) and many victory \npoints  (VPs).  Your  TR  is  increased  each  time  you  raise  a \nglobal parameter (temperature, oxygen or ocean). Your TR \ndetermines your basic income, as well as your basic score. As \nthe  terraforming  process  proceeds,  more  projects  become \nfeasible. Additional VPs are awarded for anything enhancing \nmankind’s  grip  on  the  solar  system.  This  can  be  anything,	{"page": 3, "source": "Terraforming Mars", "creator": "Jacob Fryxelius (with contributions from Stronghold Games LLC for distribution and marketing.)", "document_name": "Terraforming Mars"}

Whenever you raise one of them, your \nterraform rating also increases by that much, giving you a \nhigher income and score.\nWhen a global parameter has reached its goal, it \ncan’t be raised any further, and so does not increase your \nTR. You may still play cards and actions that increase the \nparameter - just ignore that part of the effect.\nWhen all three global parameters have reached \ntheir goal, the game ends after that generation (after the \nproduction phase).\nA Terraformed Mars	{"page": 3, "source": "Terraforming Mars", "creator": "Jacob Fryxelius (with contributions from Stronghold Games LLC for distribution and marketing.)", "document_name": "Terraforming Mars"}

At very low temperatures, oceans \nare actually glaciers for most of the year.\nAlthough the  temperature on  Mars can already reach \n20 ˚C on ’hot’ summer days, this is not enough. To enable liquid \noceans, the mean temperature has to be positive, at least at the \nequator.\nThe  most  important  parameter  for  terraforming  is	{"page": 3, "source": "Terraforming Mars", "creator": "Jacob Fryxelius (with contributions from Stronghold Games LLC for distribution and marketing.)", "document_name": "Terraforming Mars"}

Only the region around Olympus Mons is missing. \nThe areas reserved for Ocean tiles are low in elevation so water \nwill naturally flow there. The plant bonuses around the equator \nsimulate that the higher average temperature will make it easier	{"page": 4, "source": "Terraforming Mars", "creator": "Jacob Fryxelius (with contributions from Stronghold Games LLC for distribution and marketing.)", "document_name": "Terraforming Mars"}

Resource cubes are placed in their respective \nboxes, and player markers are used on the production tracks. \nIn  the  game,  resource  icons  refer  to  resource  cubes,  while \nresource  icons  inside  brown  boxes  refer  to  production  of \nthat resource (see the project card below).\n1.  Production  tracks:  If  you  gain  production  of  a  resource, \nmark  the  new  production  level  with  your  player  marker. \nProduction is not limited to 10. Example: If you play a card \nthat  increases  your  heat  production  3  steps  from  19  to  22  you \nmark this by having 2 player markers on ’10’ and 1 marker on ’2’ \non the production track above the heat box.

Resources  or  production \nwith  a red frame means that you can affect any player you \nchoose  (even  yourself).  Resources  or  production  without \nred  frames  always  affect  yourself  and  must  be  performed. \nSo card A essentially steals a titanium production from an \nopponent, while in B, D and E you must decrease your own \nenergy  or  plant  production  in  order  to  increase  your  M€ \nproduction.	{"page": 9, "source": "Terraforming Mars", "creator": "Jacob Fryxelius (with contributions from Stronghold Games LLC for distribution and marketing.)", "document_name": "Terraforming Mars"}

A tile must be placed if possible, but being \nunable to do so does not prevent you from playing the card.\nIf a card has a (*), then it is an exception to the \nnormal  rules,  and  you  must  read  the  explanation  in \nparenthesis to see details of how the card works.\nIf you ever become uncertain of a card’s function,\nread the explanation text.\nVP  icons  (see  cards  A,  D,  E)  are  ignored  for  now, \nthey will be counted in the final scoring (see page 12). Card \nD may be worth several VPs if its action (top panel) has had \ntime to work a few times to add more animal resources to the \ncard.\n3) Place the card (see illustration below).	{"page": 10, "source": "Terraforming Mars", "creator": "Jacob Fryxelius (with contributions from Stronghold Games LLC for distribution and marketing.)", "document_name": "Terraforming Mars"}

Skip any illegal placements (like areas reserved \nfor ocean). For the second city you step backwards from \nbottom right in the same fashion. Then you place the two \ngreeneries by counting the cost numbers and stepping \nclockwise around each city, starting from top left, skipping \nillegal placements.\nSpecial case: If you choose to play Tharsis Republic this \ngame, you get M€ production for the 2 neutral cities even \nthough they are placed before you reveal your corporation.\n2) Start with a terraform rating of 14 instead of 20 (marked \n’solo’ on the track) and without the extra production of \nresources decribed for the standard game.\n3) Awards and Milestones are not used.\n4) You have a neutral opponent that you can steal from, or \nreduce any kind of resources and production from.	{"page": 13, "source": "Terraforming Mars", "creator": "Jacob Fryxelius (with contributions from Stronghold Games LLC for distribution and marketing.)", "document_name": "Terraforming Mars"}

There  are  4  parameters  on \nthe game board connected to this process: Terraform rating, \ntemperature, oxygen level and ocean coverage.\nTerraform  Rating  (TR)  is  the  measure  of  how \nmuch you have contributed to the terraforming \nprocess. Each time you raise the oxygen level, the \ntemperature, or place an ocean tile, your TR increases as well. \nEach step of TR is worth 1 VP at the end of the game, and the \nTerraforming  Committee  awards  you  income  according  to	{"page": 14, "source": "Terraforming Mars", "creator": "Jacob Fryxelius (with contributions from Stronghold Games LLC for distribution and marketing.)", "document_name": "Terraforming Mars"}

You start at 20.\nThe  mean  temperature  at  the  equator  is  raised  2 \n˚C  at  a  time  from  -30˚C  to  +8˚C.  This  will  create \nan  equatorial  zone  where  water  stays  liquid.  This \nsymbol means that you raise the temperature 1 step,\nand therefore you also increase your TR 1 step.\nThe  oxygen  level  is  measured  as  a  percentage  of \nan atm of pressure, meaning that this percentage \nis comparable to Earth’s 21% oxygen. At 14% the \natmosphere resembles that of Earth at a 3000 m \nelevation. This symbol means that you raise the oxygen level \n1 step, and therefore also increase your TR 1 step.\nEach  ocean  tile  represents  1%  ocean  coverage.	{"page": 14, "source": "Terraforming Mars", "creator": "Jacob Fryxelius (with contributions from Stronghold Games LLC for distribution and marketing.)", "document_name": "Terraforming Mars"}
